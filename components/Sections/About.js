        Back in 2021, I decided to try my hand at web development and tumbled
        head first into the rabbit hole of coding and web development.
        Fast-forward to today, and I’ve had the privilege of building web
        aplicatons for <H>small business</H>, <H>agency</H>, <H>start-up </H>
        and
        <H> ecommerce shop</H>.
      </p>
      <p className="pb-3">
        My main focus these days is building accessible user interfaces for our
        customers at <H>SeoPage1</H>. I most enjoy building application in
        wordpress where design and engineering meet — things that look good but
        are also built well under the hood. In my free time, I try to learn more
        about <H>PHP OOP, JavaScript</H> and system developemet principles.

        When I’m not at the computer, I’m usually play guiter, reading, hanging
        out with my wife and friends, or playing video games
